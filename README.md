A mobile application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native that integrates AI-powered features including:
- Interactive chat with AI (RAG-enhanced)
- Text completion
- AI image generation

## Project Overview

This application demonstrates how to build a modern AI-powered mobile experience using:
- Expo & React Native for cross-platform mobile development
- AI SDK for seamless AI integration
- NativeWind for styling
- Expo Router for navigation

## Getting Started

## Application Structure

The app consists of three main tabs:
1. **Chat Tab** (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`): Full conversation interface with the AI assistant
2. **Ask Tab** (`app/(tabs)/ask.tsx`): Quick Q&A with the AI without conversation history
3. **Images Tab** (`app/(tabs)/images.tsx`): Generate AI images from text descriptions

## API Integration

The application connects to several API endpoints:
- `/api/chat`: For conversational AI interactions
- `/api/completion`: For single-prompt text completions
- `/api/generate-image`: For AI image generation

## Project Flow

1. **User Journey**:
   - Users can switch between chat, ask, and image generation tabs
   - In the chat tab, users can have ongoing conversations with the AI assistant
   - The ask tab provides quick answers to one-off questions
   - The images tab allows users to generate AI images from text descriptions

2. **Technical Flow**:
   - User inputs are processed through the UI
   - Requests are sent to the appropriate API endpoints
   - Responses are streamed back and displayed in the UI
   - Dark/light mode is supported throughout the app

## Development

### Key Technologies
- **React Native**: Core framework for mobile development
- **Expo**: Development platform for React Native
- **Expo Router**: File-based routing system
- **AI SDK**: Integration with AI APIs
